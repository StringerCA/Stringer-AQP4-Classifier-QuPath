# Stringer-AQP4-Classifier-QuPath
Pixel classifier for AQP4 quantification using QuPath (trained in v0.3.0, compatible with v0.5.1)
Stringer-AQP4-Classifier-QuPath

This repository contains a pixel-based classifier for quantifying Aquaporin-4 (AQP4) protein expression in human post-mortem brain tissue using QuPath.

Trained in: QuPath v0.3.0
Compatible with: QuPath v0.5.1
Classifier file: Stringer-AQP4-Classifier-QuPath.json (zipped)

Description
This classifier was trained using representative images of AQP4 immunohistochemistry, annotated for pixel-level classification of positive and negative expression. It was used for whole-slide image quantification of AQP4 in brain tissue from neurotypical, Down syndrome (DS), and late onset Alzheimer’s disease (LOAD) diagnostic groups.

The classifier enables objective measurement of AQP4 protein levels across large tissue sections and was validated through representative immunofluorescence labeling IHC assessments.
